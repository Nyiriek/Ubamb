# Ubamb
## Hi there, welcome to Ubamb.
The name Ubamb has been coined from Uber and Ambulance. We chose this name because the app will serve two purposes simultaneously—one for transportation and two as an ambulance.

Ubamb tackles a critical challenge in the healthcare industry, ensuring timely and appropriate transportation for pregnant women during emergency and medical appointments. Studies have shown that delays in receiving medical care during pregnancy complications can significantly increase maternal mortality rates. A 2020 report by the World Health Organization(WHO) “highlighted that postpartum haemorrhage, pre-eclampsia, and obstructed labor are leading causes of maternal death, often exacerbated by delayed access to emergency obstetric care”. Current solutions are inadequate pregnancy apps, while offering valuable information and support, lack the crucial transportation elements. Ride-sharing services, on the other hand, are not equipped to handle the specific medical needs of pregnant women in distress. Ubamb emerges as a for-profit solution that merges the functionalities of Uber and an ambulance, providing pregnant women access to dedicated ambulances staffed by trained paramedics and midwives. This ensures timely transportation and essential medical care during their journey, potentially improving maternal health outcomes.
